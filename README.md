Kinect user tracking, blob detection and physics interaction in Processing. <br />

Updated for Shiffman's Open Kinect library and Processing 3 <br />
OpenNI kinect library no longer works in Processing 3.x versions. OpenKinect lacks user body tracking with sceneImage() and userImage() functions.This version of Amnon Owed's original sketch uses KinectPV2 Library and the getBodyTrackImage() function to to make a threshold to separate user image from non-user to light and dark pixels.<br/>
